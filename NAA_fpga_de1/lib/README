Device ID extractor   : id_extractor.aocx


The following are designs that run the NengoFPGA models and are available from
Applied Brain Research. For more information on getting these files, see the
documentation at https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-de1/usage.html#updating-bitstreams.

Interface library     : pyhost_pes.so
